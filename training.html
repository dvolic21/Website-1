				<h1>Training</h1>
				<p>The training in order to become part of tank crew lasted 13 weeks. The training included everything, from how to repair certain parts of tank
				to how use the tank. In the March 1943 the training length was increased to 14 weeks. However, as war went on and there were less and less people
				possible to use the tank, the training was shorten to only 6 weeks. And in middle of August 1945 the training was only 2 weeks.</p>
				
				<p>Usually the tank had 3-5 crew members.</p>
				
				<p>The first and most important crew member was the <span style="color: red">commander</span>. His responsibilty is how the tank is operating on the battlefield. He is responsible
				for spotting other possible enemy tanks or enemy objects, he is responsible for his crew and for the tank. As it is the hardest role in the tank
				the training for the commander is hard and long. Commander also must be able to replace any crew member if something were to happen to them.</p>
				
				<p>The second important role is the <span style="color: red">driver</span>. The responsibility of the driver is to drive the tank, maintain it and fire it. Observe and judge 
				the forward terrain and monitor the instruments.</p>
				
				<p>The third crew member would be <span style="color: red">gunner</span>. His responsibility is surveillance, he must give driver the order when he is shooting. He must understand
				the information received from commander.</p>
				
				<p>The fourth and fifth crew member were <span style="color: red">loaders</span>. The size of crew was dependant on the size of the tank. Light tanks usually had only 3 members, while
				heavy tanks or self-propelled guns usually had 5 crew members. As the tank was usually loaded with more types of ammunition, the loaders responsibility
				was to inform commander on how many types of which ammunition was left. Loaders job was also to listen to information he gets and load the proper ammunition
				which was said to him by commander.</p>
