					<p class = "text">Tiger I was a German heavy tank used mainly in Africa and Soviet Union. It's first fight was in 1942. With it's 8.8cm Flak 36 gun
					and almost 120mm frontal armor,	Tiger 1 was able to outmatch any other tank on the battlefield. However Tiger I was prone of certain type tracks failures,
					limited range because of it's high fuel consumption, expensive material usage and labour-intensive production methods. That means that production of Tiger I
					was ceased in 1944 and began the production of much better Tiger II.</p>

					<p class = "text">Tiger II or Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B or shorter Tiger B, was German heavy tank. First use of the tank in combat was 
					during the Allied Invasion of Normandy on 1944. It had 8.8cm KwK 43 turret and almost 185mm frontal armor. However the Tiger II was not as great
					success as Tiger I was. Allies had no trouble disabling the tanks using 75mm field gun with HEAT ammunition. In conclusion the Tiger II was a fail because
					of it's poor armour quality.</p>

					<p class = "text">Panther was a German medium tank used in Western and Eastern Fronts in Europe. Main purpose of Panthers were to counter the
					Soviet T-34 tanks. Panther is considered one of the best tanks in WW2 because of it's firepower and protection. Biggest drawback of the tank was that
					maintenance in the field was difficult. It had 7.5cm KWK 42 L/70 gun and close to 80mm of frontal armor and close to 100mm on turret front.
					Panther was much cheaper to build than Tiger I.</p>

					<p class = "text">T-34 was the most important Soviet medium tank. It's first deployment was in 1940 against Operation Barbarossa.
					It had 76.2mm F-34 tank gun. However, it had only 45mm of protection in front and 65mm on the turret front. The only good thing about armour
					was it's 60 degree sloped armour which was good protection against anti-tank weapons. After the Germans encountered the tank, the T-34
					got the name from Germans as "the finest tank in the world". There were more than 80,000 tanks produced in WW2. After T-34 got the significant
					firepower upgrade, the tanks were renamed into T-34-85.</p>

					<p class = "text">M4 Sherman or Medium Tank, M4 was American medium tank. It was widely used by USA in WW2. The reason why it was used
					everywhere was because the tank was reliable, relatively cheap to produce and avaliable in great numbers. It had 75mm gun M3 and close to 
					177mm of frontal armor. There was 49,234 M4 Sherman produced. Because of his relatively cheap production, the tank was easily repaired or 
					serviced. The biggets advantage of the M4 Shermas was that they were superior to German light tanks and Italian tank designs.</p>

					<p class = "text">Although Great Britain did not have much excellent tanks, there were few of them. Cromwell (Cruiser, MkVIII, Cromwell)
					was a cruiser tank with high speed, reliable engine and reasonable armour. Main armament of the tank was Ordnance QF 75mm and it's armor was
					close to 76mm up front, which was later upgraded to 100mm. First deployment was in Battle of Normandy in 1944. There were close to 4,000 units
					built. Because of the medium velocity dual purpose gun, further development led to Comet which was fitted with high velocity gun.</p>

					<p class = "text">Somua S35 was French cavalry tank. It was built in 1936. The tank was superior to it's competitors because of the armour
					and armament. It was constructed from well-sloped, mainly cast, armour sections. However the production was time consuming and expensive. Because
					of that there were only about 440 units made. It had 47 mm SA 35 gun and 47mm front hull armor and 42mm turrent front. Because of how good the tanks
					were, any captured Somua S35 were used by Axis powers.</p>
